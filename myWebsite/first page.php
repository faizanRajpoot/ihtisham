          <h3>blood donation</h3>
        <p>
         When a person voluntarily donates blood for another person who is in need of blood, arising due to a medical condition,
          is called blood donation. Blood donation is carried out at the hands of a trained medical professional and in a safe environment,
           as per the medical standards.
         Donating blood is a humanitarian gesture and more people are being well aware of the need for it by each passing year. 
         It is good social work as it indicates that people are getting more sensible towards the sufferings of others. According
          to a report by the World Health Organization (WHO), around 117.4 million blood donations are collected globally. </p>

        A particular kind of injury or disease can cause a loss of blood in the affected, thereby, posing the risk of death if the blood level
         is not brought back to the normal. Blood is the vital flood that transfers oxygen to other vital body parts. With the loss of blood,
          the body doesnâ€™t get essential oxygen resulting in death.
       In such a case arises the need for voluntary blood donation from somebody else, whether known or unknown to the individual. 
       Any healthy individual could volunteer to donate blood to help a person in need. The Indian Medical Association (IMA) maintains 
      blood banks in almost every major city/town.
      Anyone who is willing to donate blood can approach these blood banks, where they will be guided further by a medical professional. 
     Hospitals and Non-government Organizations also organize blood donation camps from time to time, to encourage people for blood donation. </p>
